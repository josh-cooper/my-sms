## VSCode
Install docker desktop, compose and the vscode remote development extension (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
Remote development config is stored in .devcontainer and will set up automatically just by opening the folder in vscode.
Once container is set up rails server will autostart and vscode will forward the internal port to one available.

## Manual
Run docker compose file then install bundle and run rails server from my-sms directory.
